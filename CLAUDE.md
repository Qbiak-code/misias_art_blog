## Project Overview

This is a full-stack art portfolio blog for a young artist to showcase paintings and digital art. The platform features moderated commenting and contact forms, with the artist managing content and her father moderating interactions.

- User roles: Artist (content creation), Moderator (comment/message approval)

**Frontend**: Nuxt 4.0.2 application with water colour aesthetic
- Location: `frontend/`
- UI Framework: @nuxt/ui with Tailwind CSS v4.0

## Technology Notes

### Node.js Requirements
- Requires Node.js 18+ for crypto.hash function
- Use SQLite locally, PostgreSQL in production
- Strapi v5 tries PostgreSQL by default - configure database.js for SQLite

- Nuxt 4: New app/ directory structure, improved TypeScript
- Tailwind v4: Zero-config, 5x faster builds, automatic content detection
- Strapi v5: Enhanced Content-Type Builder, improved performance

## Deployment Strategy
- Backend: Railway with PostgreSQL (~Â£6-8/month)
- Frontend: Vercel/Netlify (free tier)
- Images: Cloudinary CDN (free tier: 25GB)
- Total cost: Â£6-8/month

## User Roles & Workflow
- **Artist (Daughter)**: Creates artwork content, views comments
- **Moderator (Father)**: Approves comments, manages contact messages
- **Visitors**: Browse gallery, comment (moderated), send contact messages
