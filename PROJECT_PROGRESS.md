# Misia's Art Portfolio - Development Progress Tracker

> **For AI Agents**: This document provides complete context for the project state, ongoing issues, and development decisions. Always read this file alongside `/CLAUDE.md` before starting work. Update this document after completing significant changes.

## 📋 Project Overview

**Project**: Full-stack art portfolio blog for a young artist  
**Frontend**: Nuxt 4.0.2 with @nuxt/ui and Tailwind CSS v4.0  
**Backend**: Strapi 5.20.0 CMS with SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)  
**Design Theme**: Water colour aesthetic with glassmorphism and modern brutalist elements  

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Project architecture, commands, and technical guidance
- `/PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` - This file - current state and issues
- `/frontend/pages/index.vue` - Main homepage (single-page currently)
- `/frontend/assets/css/main.css` - All styling (needs refactoring)

## 🎯 Current Development Goals

### Phase 1: Style Fixes & UX Issues (IN PROGRESS)
1. ✅ Mobile navigation improvements (completed)
2. ✅ Mobile lightbox scroll fixes (completed) 
3. ❌ **CURRENT BLOCKER**: Button spacing issues (not working)
4. 🔄 Card stretching problems (pending)

### Phase 2: Code Refactoring (PLANNED)
- Extract components from single-page structure
- Organize CSS into multiple files
- Create proper layouts and pages
- Add composables for state management

### Phase 3: Additional Pages (PLANNED)  
- About page
- Contact page with form
- Individual artwork pages
- Gallery filtering/categories

## 🚨 Current Critical Issues

### Issue #1: Button Spacing - Clean Redesign Approach
**Problem**: Multiple patch attempts failed - need clean solution from scratch
- Gap between buttons too small (currently 32px, needs 48px+)
- Insufficient space between text and buttons
- Previous attempts: messy CSS overrides that didn't work

**New Approach**: Remove all existing button spacing CSS and redesign cleanly
- Create proper button component spacing
- Use clean CSS without !important overrides
- Design for maintainability, not patches

**Status**: 🔄 IN PROGRESS - Clean redesign approach  
**Philosophy**: Fix properly once vs patch repeatedly

### Issue #2: Card Stretching on Large Screens
**Problem**: Artwork cards stretch to fill grid width, causing awkward proportions
**Status**: 🔄 PENDING - Address after button spacing resolved

## ✅ Completed Improvements

### Mobile Navigation Enhancement
**What Was Done:**
- Replaced basic hamburger with animated custom icon
- Enhanced mobile menu with glassmorphism design
- Added icons, hover effects, and proper footer
- Made mobile-only (hidden on desktop)

**Files Modified:**
- `index.vue`: Lines 12-57 (mobile menu structure)
- `main.css`: Lines 421-663 (mobile menu styles)

### Mobile Lightbox Fixes  
**What Was Done:**
- Fixed non-scrollable content issue
- Improved space management (image 40vh, content 50vh)
- Added touch-friendly scrolling
- Optimized button layout to prevent centering/space waste

**Files Modified:**
- `main.css`: Lines 954-998 (mobile lightbox responsive rules)

### Modern Artwork Card Actions
**What Was Done:**
- Replaced basic buttons with gradient "View Details" button
- Created circular icon buttons for heart/share actions
- Added glassmorphism effects and hover animations
- Fixed magnifying glass overlay to show only on hover

**Files Modified:**
- `index.vue`: Lines 195-209 (new button structure)
- `main.css`: Lines 411-505 (action button styles)

## 🏗️ Current Architecture Issues

### Single-File Monolith
**Problem**: Everything in one 471-line `index.vue` file
- No component extraction
- Difficult to maintain
- Violates Vue best practices

### CSS Organization
**Problem**: 1000+ lines in single `main.css` file
- No logical separation
- Hard to find/modify styles
- Should be split into: base, components, utilities, responsive

### Recommended Refactoring Structure
```
components/
├── layout/
│   ├── AppHeader.vue
│   ├── AppFooter.vue  
│   └── MobileMenu.vue
├── ui/
│   ├── BaseButton.vue
│   ├── GlassCard.vue
│   └── ArtworkCard.vue
├── sections/
│   ├── HeroSection.vue
│   ├── ArtworkGrid.vue
│   └── CallToAction.vue

assets/css/
├── main.css (base only)
├── components.css
├── utilities.css
└── responsive.css
```

## 🐛 Debugging Notes

### Button Spacing Debug Checklist
When working on button spacing issue, check:
1. Browser dev tools - are CSS rules being applied?
2. Tailwind's `gap-8` specificity vs custom CSS
3. Browser cache - hard refresh required?
4. CSS build process - is Nuxt rebuilding styles?
5. Alternative approach: modify Tailwind classes directly in HTML

### Current Environment
- Frontend dev server: `http://localhost:3001` (port 3000 taken)
- Backend Strapi: `http://localhost:1337`
- Both need to be running for full functionality
